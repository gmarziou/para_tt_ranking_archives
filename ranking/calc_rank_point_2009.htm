<h1>How to calculate ranking points ?</h1>by Ga&euml;l Marziou,  IPTTC Ranking Director (2005-07-05 valid till 2010-01-01)
<HR WIDTH="100%">

<p>When a player has participated to more than 6 tournaments, only his/her 6 best results are retained in ranking list.<br>
</p>

<p>Every IPTTC sanctioned tournament has its &quot;Sanctioning Fold&quot;, by multiplying the &quot;Points&quot; gained in the tournament by &quot;Sanctioning
Fold&quot; become, we obtain the &quot;Ranking Points&quot;. Ranking Points decide the order on ranking list, higher order gives more opportunities for World championships and Paralympic Games selection.
</p>

<h2>Sanctioning Fold:</h2>
<p>Paralympics is 100, World Championships is 80, Regional Championships is 50 (e.g. European Champ.), Others 30, 20 or 10 according
to IPTTC rules and regulations.
<p>
<h2>Reduction of Ranking Points:</h2>
<BR>
<ol>
<li>Ranking points
awarded in the Paralympics or World Championships will be 
kept unchanged for two years and then reduced to 25% of original value
and annulled by the next Paralympics / World Championships.<br>
<i>Example: if a player got 800 points in 2000 Paralympic Games, in 2001 he will still have 800 points. In 2002 (at Paralympic Games anniversary), 2003 and 2004 he will have 200 points.
</i>
<li>Ranking points
awarded in the Regional Championships will be reduced annually by 25% until the next Regional Championships in the same Region,
and then they are annulled.<br>
<i>Example: if a player got 800 points in 2003 Regional Championships, in 2004 (at Regional Championships anniversary) he will have 600 points and in 2005 his points will be replaced by the points of the new 2005 championships, if there are no championships in this region then player will have 600 points.
</i>
<li>Ranking points
awarded in other approved tournaments will be kept for one year and then they are annulled. Practically,
it may be kept for more than 1 year, 
because Ranking List will be updated only on Jan 1,Apr 1,Jul 1, and Oct
1.<BR>
<li>By cancellation
of either the Paralympics or the World Championships the 
points due for reduction this year will only be reduced by 50% and be totally 
annulled two years later.
<li>If a player
does not participate to any ranked tournament over a period of 30 months, he/she
will be eliminated from the ranking list and lose all accumulated points.

<h2>Open doubles events:</h2>

<p>The ranking points will be divided equally between the two players winning the doubles match such that one extra point is allocated to the players winning for every class above the class of the winner, it's an extension of the LDH bonus in the singles open event.
</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr><th>Team 1</th><th>Team 2</th></tr>
<tr><td>Player A is class 1</td><td>Player X is class 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Player B is class 4</td><td>Player Y is class 4</td></tr>
</table>

<p>A-B wins double against X-Y</p>

<p>We compute the difference of classes between the 2 teams and we add it to the 3 points of an open match, then we divide the result equally between the 2 players.
</p>
<p>(4+2-1-4) + 3 = 4
</p>
<p>So each player of team 1 gets 2 points.
</p>

<p>With same example but inverted result (X-Y wins double against A-B), each player of team 2 gets 1.5 points.</p>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr><th>Team 1</th><th>Team 2</th></tr>
<tr><td>Player A is class 2</td><td>Player X is class 3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Player B is class 4</td><td>Player Y is class 3</td></tr>
</table>

<p>A-B wins double against X-Y</p>

<p>We compute the difference of classes between the 2 teams and we add it to the 3 points of an open match, then we divide the result equally between the 2 players.
</p>
<p>(3+3-2-4) + 3 = 3
</p>
<p>So each player of team 1 gets 1.5 points.
