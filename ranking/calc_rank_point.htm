        How to calculate ranking points ?</h1>
    by Ga&euml;l Marziou, PTT Ranking Officer (2010-03-18)
    <hr width="100%"/>
    <p>
        When a player has participated to more than 6 tournaments, only his/her 6 best results
        are retained in ranking list.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Every ITTF PTT sanctioned tournament has its &quot;Sanctioning Fold&quot;, by multiplying
        the &quot;Points&quot; gained in the tournament by &quot;Sanctioning Fold&quot;
        become, we obtain the &quot;Ranking Points&quot;. Ranking Points decide the order
        on ranking list, higher order gives more opportunities for World championships and
        Paralympic Games selection.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Sanctioning Fold:</h2>
    <p>
        Paralympics is 100, World Championships is 80, Regional Championships is 50 (e.g.
        European Champ.), Others 30, 20 or 10 according to ITTF PTT rules and regulations.
        <p>
            <h2>
                Reduction of Ranking Points:</h2>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Ranking points awarded in the Paralympics or World Championships will be kept unchanged
                    for two years and then reduced to 25% of original value and annulled by the next
                    Paralympics / World Championships.<br>
                    <i>Example: if a player got 800 points in 2000 Paralympic Games, in 2001 he will still
                        have 800 points. In 2002 (at Paralympic Games anniversary), 2003 and 2004 he will
                        have 200 points. </i>
                    <li>Ranking points awarded in the Regional Championships will be reduced annually by
                        25% until the next Regional Championships in the same Region, and then they are
                        annulled.<br>
                        <i>Example: if a player got 800 points in 2003 Regional Championships, in 2004 (at Regional
                            Championships anniversary) he will have 600 points and in 2005 his points will be
                            replaced by the points of the new 2005 championships, if there are no championships
                            in this region then player will have 600 points. </i>
                        <li>Ranking points awarded in other approved tournaments will be kept for one year and
                            then they are annulled. Practically, it may be kept for more than 1 year, because
                            Ranking List will be updated only on Jan 1,Apr 1,Jul 1, and Oct 1.<br>
                            <li>By cancellation of either the Paralympics or the World Championships the points
                                due for reduction this year will only be reduced by 50% and be totally annulled
                                two years later.
                                <li>If a player does not participate to any ranked tournament over a period of 30 months,
                                    he/she will be eliminated from the ranking list and lose all accumulated points.

            Open doubles events:</h2>
        <p>
            The ranking points will be divided equally between the two players winning the doubles
            match such that one extra point is allocated to the players winning for every class
            above the class of the winner, it's an extension of the LDH bonus in the singles
            open event.

            <strong>Example 1</strong></p>
        <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
            <tr>
                <th>
                    Team 1
                </th>
                <th>
                    Team 2
                </th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    Player A is class 1
                </td>
                <td>
                    Player X is class 2

        <p>
            A-B wins double against X-Y</p>
        <p>
            We compute the difference of classes between the 2 teams and we add it to the 3
            points of an open match, then we divide the result equally between the 2 players.
        </p>
        <p>
            (4+2-1-4) + 3 = 4
        </p>
        <p>
            So each player of team 1 gets 2 points.
        </p>
        <p>
            With same example but inverted result (X-Y wins double against A-B), each player
            of team 2 gets 1.5 points.</p>
