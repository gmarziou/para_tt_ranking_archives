Added points of <a href="../tour_details/20040927_gre_athens.htm">Athens 2004 Paralympic Games</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: During the singles per class, 2 players had their racket positively controlled for illegal glue: Ivan Karabec (M10, CZE) and Kam Shing Kwong (M5, HKG).
Due to to this, their victories have not been counted for ranking points, only their defeats have been kept for their opponents ranking points for the matches that have been played before the disqualification.
