<p>After an appeal from the Americas Paralympic Committee, the IPTTC with the
support of the IPC has agreed not to implement its decision to reduce the
ranking factor of the IPC Americas championships held last year in Argentina
from 50 to 30.  This decision is taken in the best interests of the athletes
and sport.  However, the IPTTC re-emphasises its commitment to the World
Anti-Doping Code.  All organisers will be reminded of this commitment and of
the need to implement it in the best interests of the athletes and sport.</p>
